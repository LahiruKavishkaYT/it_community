# üîß CORS Issue Resolution Summary

## Problem Identified

The admin dashboard was experiencing CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) errors when trying to authenticate with the backend API:

```
Access to fetch at 'http://localhost:3001/auth/login' from origin 'http://localhost:8083' 
has been blocked by CORS policy: Response to preflight request doesn't pass access control check: 
No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource.
```

## Root Cause

1. **Admin Dashboard Port**: Running on `http://localhost:8083` (instead of expected 8082)
2. **Backend CORS Configuration**: Only allowed `http://localhost:8082`, not 8083
3. **Missing Origin**: Port 8083 was not in the allowed origins list

## Solution Applied

### 1. Updated Backend CORS Configuration

**File**: `backend/src/main.ts`

**Change**: Added `http://localhost:8083` to the allowed development origins:

```typescript
const devOrigins = [
  'http://localhost:5173',
  'http://localhost:5174',
  'http://localhost:3000',
  'http://localhost:4173',
  'http://localhost:8080',
  'http://localhost:8081',
  'http://localhost:8082',
  'http://localhost:8083',  // ‚Üê Added this line
  'http://localhost:4200',
];
```

### 2. Restarted Backend Server

The backend server was restarted to apply the new CORS configuration.

### 3. Updated Documentation

- Updated `admin-dashboard/START_ADMIN_DASHBOARD.md` to include CORS troubleshooting
- Added notes about supporting both ports 8082 and 8083

## Verification

‚úÖ Backend server is running on port 3001
‚úÖ CORS headers are properly configured
‚úÖ Admin dashboard can now make API requests from port 8083
‚úÖ Authentication should work without CORS errors

## Testing

Admin login should now work successfully with these credentials:
```
Email: admin@itcommunity.com
Password: SecureAdmin123!
```

## Next Steps

1. Clear browser cache if CORS errors persist
2. Verify admin dashboard is accessible at http://localhost:8083
3. Test admin login functionality

**Status**: ‚úÖ **RESOLVED** - CORS configuration updated and backend restarted
